<h1>Amazon Interview | Set 104</h1>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Online round:</strong><br /> 20 MCQs on mathematics, probability, operating systems, DBMS, compilers and basic DS concepts.<span id="more-130565"></span></p>
<p><strong>Coding questions (Full code required):</strong><br /> 1. Given an array containing zero and non-zero elements, modify the array such that it has the 0â€™s at the end and the non-zero elements at the beginning. Print the number of swaps required and the number of non-zero elements.</p>
<p>2. Given a â€˜patternâ€™ and a â€˜textâ€™ print the indexes of â€˜textâ€™ where any anagrams of â€˜patternâ€™ occur.</p>
<pre><code>  Input:
    abcdad (text)
    abcd (pattern)
  Output:
    0, 1 </code></pre>
<p><strong><br /> 1st technical:</strong><br /> 1. Given a linked list reverse the even nodes in one pass and in O(1) space.<br /> So 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8 should be converted to 1-&gt;8-&gt;3-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;7-&gt;2.</p>
<p>2. Given an array containing integers, modify the array such that the 5â€™s are at the end and the rest are at the beginning (maintaining the same order).</p>
<p><strong>2nd technical:</strong><br /> 1. 5 minute discussion about my OCR project.<br /> 2. Given an undirected graph, count the number of cycles with 3 nodes.<br /> 3. What is a spanning tree? Difference from tree, if any.<br /> 4. How to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph?<br /> 5. Given an array convert it to another array such that the following condition holds:<br /> a c e g where the modified array is {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}<br /> Input:<br /> 1,2,3,4,5,6<br /> Output:<br /> 1,3,2,5,4,6</p>
<p><strong>3rd technical:</strong><br /> 1. What do you know about memory management in Operating Systems? What is segmentation? What is paging?</p>
<p>2. Design problem: Given a station with n platforms. So each platform has one line. But these n lines join into one, after leaving the platform (on both sides). Each train has to wait a minimum of x minutes in the platform. Trains arrive from both ends. If all the platforms are occupied they wait. There is also a point beyond the end of the platform (on both sides). This point indicates that an incoming train has to wait at that point until a leaving train (from that end) passes that point. Design the whole system.</p>
<p>3. How are big files stored in memory? What are the uses of B-tree? How is it more useful than BST?</p>
<p>4. Given one billion file indexes and said that n files are missing. How would you identify the file indexes of those who are missing?</p>
<p><strong><br /> 4th technical:</strong><br /> 1. Given an array of integers. This array denotes â€˜ourâ€™ own ascending order of the elements. So if the array is {2,3,1,4}, by mathematics we can say that 2 Letâ€™s say the new array is {1,2,4,3,5,4,9,2}, output will be {2,2,3,1,4,4,5,9}. Note that since 5 and 9 do not occur, they are sorted by actual ascending order at the end.</p>
<p>2. Integers are coming in a stream. A special integer (say -9999) denotes reset. Design a data structure such that when the special integer comes the previous elements are printed in a zigzag way and all the elements are deleted (reset). And then continues to accept other integers. What DS will you use?</p>
<pre><code>Say the input is
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-9999,0,1,100,-9999,-9999,500
Output will be
 1,8,2,7,3,6,4,5
 0,100,1</code></pre>
