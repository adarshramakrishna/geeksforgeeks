<p><strong>1st Telephonic round</strong><span id="more-129242"></span></p>
<p>After few project and introduction related question.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a program to find an element in sorted and rotated array.</li>
<li>Write a program to print all path whose sum is equal to a given number path must start from the root node and it may or may not end at the leaf.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Telephonic round</strong></p>
<p>After 3-4 days</p>
<p>Some c/c++ question what is malloc how does it work and memory layout and allocation related questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a program to find longest repeating substring In a given string running code were required covering all base cases.</li>
<li>U have given 10 files and you have given a string suggest data structure which ll facilitate efficient search of string in the file if string appears more than ones in that case u have to print line number and file in which they appear.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 15 days I got cal that I have cleared the telephonic round and my F-2-F interview is going to take place in Hyderabad</p>
<p><strong>F-2-F round 1</strong></p>
<p>After introduction and project related questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a program to print a tree in vertical order asked more than one approach to do this problem and modified problem many times.</li>
<li>Write a program to convert a tree to doubly link list in post-order fashion only change of pointer are allowed that is left pointer can work as previous and right pointer s as next.</li>
</ol>
<p>This interview went well J</p>
<p> <br /> <strong>F-2-F round 2(Bar raiser)</strong></p>
<p>Few question related to OS what is deadlock, Race-condition, Semaphore and many more, few question Related to DBMS what is Normalization define all normal forms(I directly told him I donâ€™t remember I read it in 5<sup>th</sup> semester )</p>
<ol>
<li>Why amazon??</li>
<li>Why do u want to leave company XYZ.</li>
<li>Your biggest challenge till the date.</li>
<li>Many project related question.</li>
</ol>
<p>Data structure</p>
<ol>
<li>U have given 10 files each having 1 million integer in sorted order, physical memory have size of 3 million suggest method to extract 1 million integer in sorted form efficiently.</li>
<li>Write a program to convert a decimal number into binary your code should work on both big endian and small endian machine. U have given a variable which tell u whether machine is big endian or small endian</li>
</ol>
<p>DBMS and few bar raiser question made this round average L</p>
<p><strong>F-2-F round 3</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You have given an n-ary tree write a program to check whether this tree is sum tree or not.</li>
<li>Given an array write a program to find kth smallest element in the array. He was hardly interested in the solution he just want to know how many ways u can solve it solved using 5-6 method at the end he was satisfied with the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>F-2-F round 4</strong></p>
<p>Longest oneâ€¦.this interview went on for 1 hour and 30 minutes but was interesting one(interviewer looked lyk a frustrated guyâ€¦some tyms I felt that he is going to punch me <img src="media/file5.gif" alt=":P" /> :P)</p>
<ol>
<li>You have given M array each of size n all array are sorted separately write a program to make a big sorted array of size m*n . during discussion he told me to prove many lemma like height of tree is log(n)( for n elements) sum of n natural number is (n*n+1)/2 and many more. He modified problem many times donâ€™t use extra space do it in space etc. discussion went on for almost 1 hour but at the end he was happy with the solutions(I suggested 2 method and further optimization in them.</li>
<li>U have given an binary matrix which is sorted row wise and column wise write a program to search a row in the matrix having maximum number of zeroes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally this interview also went well he was happy with my performance</p>
<p>After 2-3 days I got mail from the HR that I m rejected LL reason was bar raiser â€¦ 1 advise to all donâ€™t take BR round lightly it does not matter how well u performed in other round if u didnâ€™t do well in BR round then there is no way u can make it. An average round tech interview is fine but average BR round means rejected.</p>
